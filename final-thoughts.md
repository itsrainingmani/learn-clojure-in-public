# ClojureFam - Final Thoughts

Well this review has been a few days coming. After the end of the 35 days, I needed some time to reset and work on some other projects. I was able to finish *Pomato* which is a Pomodoro Timer app that I built using re-frame. I also went around working on different Athens GitHub issues.

Learning in Public has been an *experience* to say the least. I am very happy to say that my experience has been a success! I wrote a post and tweeted every day for 35 days, completed 93 4Clojure problems, finished reading Clojure from the Ground Up and Brave and True Clojure and had 5 PRs merged into the Athens Codebase! I think that last point is what I'm most proud of. To give some personal context, I've been a developer professionaly for ~2.8 years but my open source contributions have been lacking, though not for a lack of trying. Athens is the first project where I've felt like I could make an impact.

Let's dive backwards in time to understand what ClojureFam is.

*zoop*

## What is ClojureFam and why should you care

I learned about ClojureFam from a tweet by Team Seneca's very own Adrien.
