# ClojureFam - Week 5 - Day 1

Concurrent-ify tasks that are completely independent of each other.
No risk since there is no shared access to a mutable state

`pmap` -> each application of the mapping function happens on a separate thread

```clojure
;; (time (dorun (map clojure.string/lower-case orc-names)))
;; "Elapsed time: 295.426771 msecs"

;; (time (dorun (pmap clojure.string/lower-case orc-names)))
;; "Elapsed time: 129.370606 msecs"
```

There is some overhead involved with creating and coordinating threads.
grain size - amount of work done by each parallelized task. Sometimes, the overhead can be more than the time for each function application.

Solution to make `pmap` take less time is to increase the grain size. (applying the mapping function to two elements instead of one)

### Chapter Exercises

1. Create an atom with the initial value 0, use swap! to increment it a couple of times, and then dereference it.

```clojure
(def a (atom 0))
(swap! a inc)
(swap! a inc)
@a
;; => 2
```

2. Create a function that uses futures to parallelize the task of downloading random quotes fromhttp://www.braveclojure.com/random-quote

```clojure
(defn get-quote [] (slurp "https://www.braveclojure.com/random-quote"))

(defn quote-word-count
  [num-quotes]
  (let [word-freq (atom {})]
    (dotimes [i num-quotes]
      (deref (future (let [cur-quote (as-> (get-quote) x
                                       (clojure.string/replace x #"--" "")
                                       (clojure.string/replace x #"\n" "")
                                       (clojure.string/lower-case x))
                           cur-freq (frequencies (clojure.string/split cur-quote #" "))]
                       (swap! word-freq merge cur-freq)))))
    (deref word-freq)))

(println (quote-word-count 5))
```

3. Create representations of two characters in a game. The first character has 15 hit points out of a total of 40. The second character has a healing potion in his inventory. Use refs and transactions to model the consumption of the healing potion and the first character healing.

```clojure
(def player1 (ref {:handle "Kirito" :hitpoints 15/40 :inventory {:sword "Dual Blades" :healing-potion 0}}))
(def player2 (ref {:handle "Asuna" :hitpoints 33/40 :inventory {:healing-potion 1}}))

(dosync
 (alter player2 update-in [:inventory :healing-potion] dec)
 (alter player1 assoc :hitpoints 40/40))

@player1
;; => {:handle "Kirito",
;;     :hitpoints 40/40,
;;     :inventory {:sword "Dual Blades", :healing-potion 0}}

@player2
;; => {:handle "Asuna", :hitpoints 33/40, :inventory {:healing-potion 0}}
```
