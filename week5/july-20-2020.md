# ClojureFam - Week 5 - Day 1

Ah how soon ClojureFam is coming to an end. This marks the last week of the program. But I have a good feeling that I will continue to be a part of the community even after the program ends.

Today we continue where we left off with Chapter 10! And by golly was I able to get through a lot today! Ch11 and Ch12 too! But I ended up kinda skimming through the chapters a little bit because I wanted to get through them.

I definitely have to come back to the chapter about `core.async` because its really fun and I think I should have a deeper understanding of it.

## What I learned today

Concurrent-ify tasks that are completely independent of each other.
No risk since there is no shared access to a mutable state

`pmap` -> each application of the mapping function happens on a separate thread

```clojure
;; (time (dorun (map clojure.string/lower-case orc-names)))
;; "Elapsed time: 295.426771 msecs"

;; (time (dorun (pmap clojure.string/lower-case orc-names)))
;; "Elapsed time: 129.370606 msecs"
```

There is some overhead involved with creating and coordinating threads.
grain size - amount of work done by each parallelized task. Sometimes, the overhead can be more than the time for each function application.

Solution to make `pmap` take less time is to increase the grain size. (applying the mapping function to two elements instead of one)

### Chapter 10 Exercises

1. Create an atom with the initial value 0, use swap! to increment it a couple of times, and then dereference it.

```clojure
(def a (atom 0))
(swap! a inc)
(swap! a inc)
@a
;; => 2
```

2. Create a function that uses futures to parallelize the task of downloading random quotes fromhttp://www.braveclojure.com/random-quote

```clojure
(defn get-quote [] (slurp "https://www.braveclojure.com/random-quote"))

(defn quote-word-count
  [num-quotes]
  (let [word-freq (atom {})]
    (dotimes [i num-quotes]
      (deref (future (let [cur-quote (as-> (get-quote) x
                                       (clojure.string/replace x #"--" "")
                                       (clojure.string/replace x #"\n" "")
                                       (clojure.string/lower-case x))
                           cur-freq (frequencies (clojure.string/split cur-quote #" "))]
                       (swap! word-freq merge cur-freq)))))
    (deref word-freq)))

(println (quote-word-count 5))
```

3. Create representations of two characters in a game. The first character has 15 hit points out of a total of 40. The second character has a healing potion in his inventory. Use refs and transactions to model the consumption of the healing potion and the first character healing.

```clojure
(def player1 (ref {:handle "Kirito" :hitpoints 15/40 :inventory {:sword "Dual Blades" :healing-potion 0}}))
(def player2 (ref {:handle "Asuna" :hitpoints 33/40 :inventory {:healing-potion 1}}))

(dosync
 (alter player2 update-in [:inventory :healing-potion] dec)
 (alter player1 assoc :hitpoints 40/40))

@player1
;; => {:handle "Kirito",
;;     :hitpoints 40/40,
;;     :inventory {:sword "Dual Blades", :healing-potion 0}}

@player2
;; => {:handle "Asuna", :hitpoints 33/40, :inventory {:healing-potion 0}}
```

### Chapter 11

core.async describes a useful model for concurrency and processes.

* process -> concurrently running unit of logic that responds to events
* `go` - creates a new process. `go` blocks execute concurrently on a separate thread.
* `<!` - take function. Listens to the channel and the process waits until a message arrives in the channel.
* use chan buffers to put multiple values into a channel without waiting
* parking - frees up the thread so it can keep doing work. allows instructions from multiple processes to interleave on a single thread. only possible within `go` blocks.

### Chapter 12 - JVM

Working with the JVM!

* Clojure is hosted on the JVM.
* Need to use Java objects for core functionality like reading files and dates
* Java has a lot of libraries

The JVM translates code into low-level instructions called *Java Bytecode*. 
JIT compilation - A running JVM executes bytecode by translating it on the fly into into machine code that its host will understand.

* Compile a program into a .class file -> packaged into a JAR file -> JVM executes the bytecode -> JVM sends machine instructions to the CPU.

* `(:gen-class)` - Clojure compiler generates a class for the namespace
* Define a `-main` function in a namespace, include `(:gen-class)` and set the `:main` directive in *project.clj* ot let the program be compiled by Java as a JAR.

### Interop

Call methods on an object using `(.methodName object)`. This uses macros to expand the *dot special form*.

```clojure
(macroexpand-1 '(.toUpperCase "By Bluebeard's bananas!"))
; => (. "By Bluebeard's bananas!" toUpperCase)

(macroexpand-1 '(.indexOf "Let's synergize our bleeding edges" "y"))
; => (. "Let's synergize our bleeding edges" indexOf "y")

(macroexpand-1 '(Math/abs -3))
; => (. Math abs -3)
```

Create objects with `(new ClassName opt-args)` or `(Classname. opt-args)`

Importing has the same effect as it does in Java -> You can use classes without having to type out the entire package prefix.

`(import java.util.Stack.)`

Within a `ns` macro - 

```clojure
(ns pirate.talk
  (:import [java.util Date Stack]
           [java.net Proxy URI]))
```

You can use seq functions to read data from a stack. But can't use conj or into

```clojure
(doto (java.util.Stack.)
  (.push "Latest ep of GoT")
  (.push "Whoops, I meant something else"))

;; doto returns the object rather than the value of the method calls

(System/getenv)

(System/getProperty "user.dir")
;; => "/Users/mani/repos/learn-clojure-in-public/code/clojure-noob"

(System/getProperty "java.version")
;; => "14.0.1"
```

IO with Clojure - 

```clojure
(spit "/tmp/hercules-todo-list"
      "- kill dat lion brov
- chop up what nasty multi-headed snake thing")

(slurp "/tmp/hercules-todo-list")
;; => "- kill dat lion brov\n- chop up what nasty multi-headed snake thing"

(with-open [todo-list-str (clojure.java.io/reader "/tmp/hercules-todo-list")]
  (println (first (line-seq todo-list-str))))
;; => kill dat lion bruv
```

## Takeaway

I went through quite a few different pieces of information about Clojure today. But the downside is that I didn't gain a deep understanding of it. So I'll have to go back and understand it.

Today's tally - 
* Complete ch 10
* Complete ch 11
* Complete ch 12
