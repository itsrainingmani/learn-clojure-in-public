# learn-clojure-in-public

I am using this repository along with my [personal blog](https://itsrainingmani.dev/learning) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/itsrainingmani) to act as a public record of my progress.

Starting June 22nd, 2020 I will be a part of Athens Research's ClojureFam Cohort and I will be learning Clojure in Public.

You can find all the code under the *code* folder.

The README will also have a table of my day-to-day progress for easy grokking.
