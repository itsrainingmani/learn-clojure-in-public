# Learning Clojure in Public

I am using this repository along with my [personal blog](https://itsrainingmani.dev/learning) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/itsrainingmani) to act as a public record of my progress.

Starting June 22nd 2020, I will be beginning my Clojure journey anew with ClojureFam’s 4th Cohort. I have high hopes that I will be able to engage constructively with my fellow learners and that being held publicly accountable to the standards I’ve set for myself will be a locus of motivation.

You can find all the code under the _code_ folder.

The README will also have a table of my day-to-day progress for easy grokking.

## Expectations

* 2/35   Daily post/tweets about what I’ve learned.
* 2/12   Chapters from Clojure from the Ground Up
* [ ]    Complete the excellent Clojure for the Brave and True book
* 20/156 Clojure exercises on 4Clojure.com
* 0/3    Making atleast 3 commits/pull requests to Athen’s Research Open Source Repo
