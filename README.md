I am using this repository along with my [personal blog](https://itsrainingmani.dev/learning) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/itsrainingmani) to act as a public record of my progress.

Starting June 22nd 2020, I will be beginning my Clojure journey anew with ClojureFam’s 4th Cohort. I have high hopes that I will be able to engage constructively with my fellow learners and that being held publicly accountable to the standards I’ve set for myself will be a locus of motivation.

## Repo Structure

You can find all the code under the `code` folder.

```shell
code
├── katas           Solutions to 4Clojure & other challenge problems
├── clojure-noob    Code for Brave and True Clojure
└── ground-up       Code for Ground and Up Clojure
```

The `cheatsheets` folder contains cheatsheets for Emacs and Clojure

## Expectations

- [ ] Daily post/tweets about what I’ve learned.
- [x] Complete Clojure from the Ground Up
- [x] Complete the excellent Clojure for the Brave and True book
- [x] Finish atleast 50 Clojure exercises on 4Clojure.com
- [x] Making atleast 3 commits/pull requests to Athen’s Research Open Source [Repo](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens)
