# ClojureFam - Week 1 - Day 7

The End of Week 1 is already here. It just feels like yesterday when I found out about Athens and Clojure Fam. And now afte a week of learning and holding myself publicly accountable, I feel like I've experienced a rapid amount of growth and confidence, not just in Clojure but also in myself as a Learner.

## Summary of Week 1

Here's what I was able to do this week - 

* 6 chapters of Clojure from the Ground Up
* 50 4Clojure problems
* A blogpost and tweet everyday capturing my thoughts, what I learned etc.
* 3 chapters of Clojure for the Brave and True
* Lots of note-taking and organization of knowledge
* Learning about the Athens tech stack and personal knowledge management systems in general
* Clojure Pair programming session with @nthd3gr33
