;; If you can perform all of an abstractionâ€™s operations on an object, then that object is an instance of the abstraction
;; 
;; A sequence is a collection of elements organized in linear order vs an unordered collection or a graph without a before-after
;; relationship between its nodes
;; 
;; Implements functions in terms of sequence abstractions. map, reduce take a seq.
;; 
;; If the core sequence functions (first, rest and cons) work on a DS, it implements the sequence abstraction.

;; Abstraction through indirection
;; Indirection is a term for a mechanism that a programming language employs so that one name can have multiple, related meanings
;; Polymorphic functions dispatch to different function bodies based on the type of the argument supplied.
;; 
;; Whenever a Clojure function expects a seq, it uses the seq function on the data structure in order to obtain a data structure that
;; allows for first, rest and cons
;; 
;; seq always returns a value that looks like a list
