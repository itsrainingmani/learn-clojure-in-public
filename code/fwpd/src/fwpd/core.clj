;; Chapter Exercises
;; 1. Turn the result of your glitter filter into a list of names.

(defn glitter-filter-list
  [records]
  (map :name records))

;; 2. Write a function, append, which will append a new suspect to your list of suspects.

(defn append
  [suspect-list name glitter]
  (conj suspect-list {:name name, :glitter glitter}))

(def sus-list (mapify (parse (slurp filename))))
(append sus-list "Jim Moriarty" "300")

;; 3. Write a function, validate, which will check that :name and :glitter-index are present when you append. The validate function should accept two arguments: a map of keywords to validating functions, similar to conversions, and the record to be validated.

(defn validate
  [kw-validate-fn record]
  (apply = true (map (fn [k] (contains? (keys kw-validate-fn) (key k))) record)))

;; 4. Write a function that will take your list of maps and convert it back to a CSV string. Youâ€™ll need to use the clojure.string/join function.

(defn collapse-map
  [records]
  (clojure.string/join "\n" (map (fn [r] (clojure.string/join "," (map str (vals r)))) records)))
